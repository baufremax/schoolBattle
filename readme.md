School Battle

You can play this game by running "schoolBattle.py". Please make sure that you have installed the module "pygame" and run it under python3.x, or you can choose to run the game under the virtual environment "my_env" which has installed pygame in advance.
This is a game written with python and pygame. It is similar to Plane Wars, you can use [UP] [LEFT] [RIGHT] [DOWN] to move your own school badge, and press space to shoot enemies. The higher score you get, the faster the enemies and your shooting will become. 
Enjoy your playing~
